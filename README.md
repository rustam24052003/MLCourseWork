# Machine Learning Project - Classification and Regression

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks focusing on implementing and evaluating machine learning models for **classification** and **regression** tasks. Each notebook demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using various algorithms and techniques.

## Contents

- `CLASSIFICATION.ipynb`: Notebook implementing various classification algorithms with data preprocessing, training, cross-validation, and model evaluation.
- `REGRESSION.ipynb`: Notebook implementing multiple regression models with data preparation, dimensionality reduction, and model assessment.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Files Overview

### 1. CLASSIFICATION.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates how to handle a classification dataset using various machine learning algorithms, including:
- **Logistic regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)**

#### Steps included:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize features for improved model performance.
3. **Model Training**: Train multiple classifiers with 5-fold cross-validation.
4. **Evaluation**: Display accuracy scores.

#### Running the Notebook
1. Launch the notebook using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook CLASSIFICATION.ipynb
    ```
2. Execute cells sequentially to train and evaluate each model.

### 2. REGRESSION.ipynb

This notebook explores regression models for predicting continuous target variables. Algorithms used include:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Regressor**
- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)**

#### Steps included:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load data, visualize distributions, and check correlations.
2. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Apply PCA to reduce features and visualize principal components.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Train regression models, cross-validate, and plot predictions against actual values.

#### Running the Notebook
1. Launch the notebook using Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook REGRESSION.ipynb
    ```
2. Execute cells to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate results.

## Results

The classification notebook provides accuracy scores, confusion matrices, and classification reports, enabling a comparative study of the models. The regression notebook includes mean squared error (MSE) scores and plots predicted vs. actual values for assessing model accuracy.

## Notes

- **Warnings**: In the `MLP` classifier/regressor, warnings related to convergence may appear if the model does not converge within the specified maximum iterations. Increase `max_iter` or adjust `tol` to resolve these warnings.
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation has been used to assess the generalization of each model.
